The world of Hadoop and "Big Data" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course, I understood what those systems are and how they fit together learned how to use them to solve real business problems!

I learned the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course, taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.

## Course Highlights:
* Install and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks and the Ambari UI
* Manage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce
* Write programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark
* Store and query your data with Sqoop, Hive, MySQL, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, Drill, Phoenix, and Presto
* Design real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem
* Learn how your cluster is managed with YARN, Mesos, Zookeeper, Oozie, Zeppelin, and Hue
* Handle streaming data in real time with Kafka, Flume, Spark Streaming, Flink, and Storm
* Understanding Hadoop is a highly valuable skill for anyone working at companies with large amounts of data.

This course was comprehensive, covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises, so I could get some real experience in using Hadoop.
